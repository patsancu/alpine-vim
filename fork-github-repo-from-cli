Having already cloned the repo, but not forked it
--------------------------------------------------

* Ideally, create the repo with: https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#create

* If not, create it via forking the repo.

* In this example, it will be https://github.com/JAremko/alpine-vim

* Forking it will result in https://github.com/octosh/alpine-vim

* Off the top of my head 

* In your local, add a new remote to your fork; then fetch it, and push your changes up to it
```
    git remote add my-fork https://github.com/octosh/alpine-vim
    git fetch my-fork
    git push my-fork
```

Traditionally
--------------
Otherwise, if you want to follow convention:

1. Fork their repo on Github
2. In your local, rename your origin remote to upstream

    git remote rename origin upstream

3. Add a new origin

    git remote add origin git@github...my-fork

4. Fetch & push

    git fetch origin
    git push origin
